Issues with SRM support
***********************

For SRM, potential for multiple quantitative values for a given MS1 region
	- We might choose to have one or more features to represent these
	- Agreed that Q3 m/z is a mandatory CV term for Feature
	
- We need to try converting some Waters XEVO raw data in mzML to see if SRM data are represented in <spectrum> or <chromatogram>
- Plus conversion from Thermo Vantage 

?- for absolute quantification, where a standard is spiked in, need to capture the spike-in concentration (for the reference/standard only)
	- at each peptide per assay.
	- different spike-in concentrations for each peptide within a single assay
	- not contained within the raw file/skyline output? would need manually adding? 	not feasible?
